<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Rohit Poonia, currently working with IBM on Oracle technologies specifically in Middleware part
  where multiple application needs to be integrated with each other so I build integrations between those applications.
</p>

<p>Right now I am trying to learn the new technologies which will help me touch and help the people in more direct
  way possible and it will open the path for me to learn and undertand the way of working so that I can be freelance for myself.</p>
